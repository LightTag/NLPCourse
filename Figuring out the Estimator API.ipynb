    "## How to write a model function \n",
    "So the transformer model function is [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/official/transformer/transformer_main.py#L69)\n",
    "Notably, it's signature is \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def model_fn(features, labels, mode, params):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "I guess features is inputs, labels is labels, I know that mode is one of [Train,Test,Predict] or something semantically equaivalent. \n",
    "If you look [here]((https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/official/transformer/transformer_main.py#L81-L89) you'll see that the model returns something in the case that mode==PREDICT and then [here]((https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/official/transformer/transformer_main.py#L125-L138) something else if mode==TRAIN.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cool. so first thing we know is that it should do different things based on mode. This is actually super duper awesome because before this their wasn't a canonical way to make that seperation and every project reinvented the wheel. So while a bit complex, it's great. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the model_fn returning\n",
    "So when we look at what the model function is returing we see it returns an [EstimatorSpec](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/EstimatorSpec)  \n",
    "```python\n",
    "      return tf.estimator.EstimatorSpec(mode=mode, loss=loss, train_op=train_op)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Just looking at how it's called here this thing actually makes sense. \n",
    "The docs say\n",
    "\n",
    ">For mode == ModeKeys.TRAIN: required fields are loss and train_op.\n",
    "\n",
    ">For mode == ModeKeys.EVAL: required field is loss.\n",
    "\n",
    ">For mode == ModeKeys.PREDICT: required fields are predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "So that tells us what the minumum we need to pass in. I wonder why we need to pass the loss into the estimator during training, since I assume it's implied in the training op that is minimizing the loss. But whatever.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Where did loss and train_op come from ?\n",
    "\n",
    "So we saw in that little python snippet that we pass loss and train_op but where did they come from ?\n",
    "So in the begining of the model_fn they do \n",
    "```python\n",
    "    model = transformer.Transformer(params, mode == tf.estimator.ModeKeys.TRAIN)\n",
    "\n",
    "    logits = model(inputs, targets)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Where transformer is an import from some other directory. \n",
    "Then, once they've checked they are not in prediction mode, they calculate the loss\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    xentropy, weights = metrics.padded_cross_entropy_loss(\n",
    "        logits, targets, params[\"label_smoothing\"], params[\"vocab_size\"])\n",
    "    loss = tf.reduce_sum(xentropy) / tf.reduce_sum(weights)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Then they check if they are in eval or train mode, and if they are in train mode they also set up the train op \n",
    "```python\n",
    "      train_op, metric_dict = get_train_op_and_metrics(loss, params)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Where get_train_op_and_metrics is defined in the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Two patterns emerge\n",
    "The first pattern to emerge is that they calculate only what is needed. Instead of saying calculate we can say they only set up the graph-ops that are needed. E.g. they don't make the train_op if they don't need it. I wonder if this is just good engineering or serves a more \"practical purpose\", e.g. to leave space on GPU or someething. \n",
    "\n",
    "Second pattern to emerge, which is **more important** is their use of imports and helper functions. Obviously this is a good pratice, and I mention it because i feel that when I copy and paste from X I'm not always confident about what \"style\" of programming I can use. This holds especially true in ML and frontend code where the software engineering chops vary wildly within the respective communities. But I digress\n"

    "# Who calls the model_fn ?\n",
    "So we've seen that the model_fn they define returns an esitmator spec when it gets data and a mode. Who calls it the model_fn and where does it get the data from ? \n",

The thing is, model_fn is called with features and labels, where did they come from ? It's not obvious just from looking at this function. I can only assume that it's somehow specified in params. I vaugely remembered something about an input_fn so I searched the code for it and found \n",
